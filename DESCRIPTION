Description: Automatically score word identification in speech 
    perception research, such as studies involving listener understanding 
    of speech in background noise or disordered speech. The program uses a 
    flexible number of rules that determine whether a response set of words 
    (i.e., listener transcriptions) match a target set of words (i.e., 
    speech corpus). At the most basic level, Autoscore counts words in the 
    listener transcript as correct if they match the words in the target 
    phrase exactly (regardless of word order), or match a homophone or common 
    misspelling of the target word. Individual rules can be applied or removed, 
    depending on the needs of researcher and the scoring rules of the research 
    lab.
